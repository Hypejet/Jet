# ✈️ Jet
[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A brand new Minecraft server software made from scratch that aims to be multithreaded, user-friendly and to have a modern API.

Jet does not have any vanilla features reimplemented, such as combat or fluids, making it good for simple minigame servers.

## Install
To install Jet you need to download a server jar file from github, which you run like a normal java application.

## Usage
Using Jet is not very different than Craftbukkit based software, except of not having vanilla features and their properties.

You have a basic configuration file, which contains the most important settings for the server.

If you want to implement features on your server, you need to make plugins using our [API](https://github.com/Hypejet/Jet/api), which you put into a `plugins` subdirectory.

## Contributing
You can contribute to Jet easily by creating pull requests, without any other needs.

To not waste your time, make sure to join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/kS4CuPvYD2) and ask if your controbution would be merged or not. You can also make that via an issue, however it may take longer to get a response.

## License
All Jet components (except of API) are licensed under a GPL 3.0 license. However, the API is licensed under a MIT license to allow plugins to be done like their authors want.
